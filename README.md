# Data Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Data Science Learning Journey**! This repository is a collection of projects and exercises designed to showcase my progress in data analysis and machine learning. The primary goal here is to demonstrate my understanding of key concepts and my passion for learning in the field of data science.

## üìú Purpose of this Repository

This repository serves as:
1. **A learning portfolio**: While these projects are derivative and didactic, they reflect my dedication to improving my skills in data analysis and machine learning.
2. **An exploration of data science and machine learning concepts**: These projects cover a variety of techniques and tools, allowing me to explore the core aspects of data science in a hands-on way.

I aim to show my progress through well-documented, credited work rather than groundbreaking innovations.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About the Projects

- **Derivative and Educational**: Many of the projects here are inspired by online courses, tutorials, and open datasets. I‚Äôve documented the sources and credits to highlight the inspiration behind each project.
- **Exploratory and Iterative**: These projects allow me to experiment with different data science workflows, tools, and techniques. Each project represents a step forward in my learning journey.
- **Properly Cited**: I've taken care to credit any tutorials, courses, or datasets used to ensure transparency and to respect the intellectual property of original authors.

## üîó Project List

- **Project 1**: Understanding PCA: I test this compression techinque both with the sklearn method, and with the naive method that uses elementary linear algebra and I compare the results of the two appraches. 


For each project, you‚Äôll find:
- **Code**: The Jupyter notebooks or scripts used in the analysis.
- **Documentation**: Markdown files explaining the approach and insights.
- **References**: Links to the original sources, tutorials, or datasets.

## üìà My Learning Goals

This repository will continue to evolve as I learn new techniques and expand my understanding. In the near future, I aim to:
- Work on more independent and original projects
- Explore advanced topics such as natural object detection, time-series analysis, and model deployment
